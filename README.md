**Purpose:**
Write a simulation that explores the effects of limited memory and memory management policies.

**Programming Language Used:**	
C++


**File Names:**	

     1. p2-roykumont.tar
     2. in1.txt: Input file name
     3. out1.txt: sample output file for memory block size 100
     4. out2.txt: sample output file for memory block size 200
     5. out3.txt: sample output file for memory block size 400
     6. main.cpp: Main File containing the memory management functionality.
     7. process.h: Header File containing the definition for input file structure.
     8. memblock.h: Header File containing the definition for memory block structure.
     9. Makefile: Makefile to build the main.cpp, process.h and memblock.h
     
**To run our program:**	

    1. Download tar archive.
    2. Extract files from tar archive.
    3. Open terminal in directory where files are located.
    4. In terminal type make and press enter.
    5. Then enter ./output.    
    6. Please keep the input file name as in1.txt(Hardcoded into program).
    7. Enter total memory size and page size(1 for 100, 2 for 200 and 3 for 400).
    8. Output will be generated into terminal window.
